# Chrome Extension Permission Fix

## Issue
The Chrome Web Store rejected the extension because it requested the "storage" permission but didn't actually use it. This is commonly referred to as requesting unnecessary permissions (sometimes called "Purple Potassium" in Chrome extension review context).

## Root Cause
The `manifest.json` file was requesting the `"storage"` permission in the permissions array, but the extension code never used `chrome.storage` APIs anywhere.

## Fix Applied
Removed the unused `"storage"` permission from the manifest.json file.

### Before:
```json
"permissions": [
  "activeTab",
  "storage",      // ← UNUSED PERMISSION
  "scripting"
],
```

### After:
```json
"permissions": [
  "activeTab",
  "scripting"
],
```

## Permissions Audit
Here's what each remaining permission is used for:

### ✅ `"activeTab"`
- **Used in**: `popup.js`
- **Purpose**: Access the currently active tab
- **Code usage**:
  ```javascript
  const [tab] = await chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true });
  textContent = await chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, { action: 'getTextContent' });
  ```

### ✅ `"scripting"`
- **Used in**: `popup.js`
- **Purpose**: Inject content scripts and execute scripts in web pages
- **Code usage**:
  ```javascript
  await chrome.scripting.executeScript({
    target: { tabId: tab.id },
    files: ['content.js']
  });
  ```

### ✅ `"host_permissions": ["https://extbackend.azurewebsites.net/*"]`
- **Used in**: `background.js`
- **Purpose**: Make API calls to the Azure backend service
- **Code usage**:
  ```javascript
  const response = await fetch('https://extbackend.azurewebsites.net/generate-startup-ideas', {...});
  ```

## Validation
- ✅ Manifest validates without errors
- ✅ All requested permissions are actually used in the code
- ✅ No unnecessary permissions remain
- ✅ Extension functionality preserved

## Result
The extension now only requests the minimum permissions required for its functionality, which should resolve the Chrome Web Store rejection issue.
